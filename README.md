# heart_attack_data_analysis
Our goal is to effectively predict heart attacks before they happen. The reason we chose this specific dataset is because of the rapid increase in heart
attack cases in our country, and we want to figure out the causes and reasons for such a disease to happen, and how it relates to other physiological factors 
in our bodies. using data easily obtainable from Kaggle, a data science company.
